#Study of Absenteeism Reasons.
Absenteeism is the term given when an employee is habitually and frequently absent from work. This excludes paid leave and occasions where an employer has granted an employee time off. If you’re a manager, supervisor, or team leader, you’ll have likely experienced cases of absenteeism. You should know that staff will be absent from time to time, such as for illness, jury duty, or bereavement. However, when absenteeism is frequent and excessive it begins to become a problem.
Below are some of the problems:
Reduced productivity levels.
High administration costs.
Increased labour costs if you hire replacement temporary workers.
Understaffing which could lead to poor customer service.
Poor morale among colleagues. This will be particularly prevalent if employees constantly have to fill in for absent staff and if they don’t see any retributions for absence.
